Vedic Multiplier (4Ã—4, Verilog)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Ã— 4-bit Vedic Multiplier in Verilog, producing an 8-bit output.
It uses the Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra ("Vertically and Crosswise") from Vedic mathematics to perform fast multiplication.
The design is modular, breaking the multiplication into 2Ã—2 blocks and then combining results using ripple-carry adders.

ðŸ›  Features

Multiplies two 4-bit inputs to produce an 8-bit product.

Based on Vedic multiplication for reduced delay compared to traditional array multipliers.

Modular design:

two_bit â€“ Multiplies two 2-bit numbers.

ripple_add â€“ Adds partial products.

vedic â€“ Top-level 4Ã—4 multiplier combining submodules.

Easily scalable to higher bit-widths.
ðŸ“œ Module Descriptions
1. two_bit

Takes two 2-bit numbers and produces a 4-bit product.

Used as building blocks for larger multipliers.

2. ripple_add

Adds two 4-bit numbers (plus carry) using a ripple-carry approach.

Used to sum partial products in the multiplication process.

3. vedic (Top Level)

Inputs: A[3:0], B[3:0] (two 4-bit numbers)

Output: OUT[7:0] (8-bit product)

Process:

Split A and B into 2-bit halves.

Multiply lower halves and store in OUT[0] and OUT[1].

Multiply cross-pairs and add results using ripple_add.

Multiply upper halves and add to final partial sum.

âš™ Working Principle (Urdhva Tiryakbhyam)

The Vedic multiplication method works vertically and crosswise:

Multiply the least significant bits â†’ write to productâ€™s LSB.

Multiply and sum crosswise terms â†’ middle bits.

Multiply the most significant bits â†’ productâ€™s MSB.

Combine all results using adders.

This method minimizes carry propagation and improves speed.
